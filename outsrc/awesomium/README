Thanks for downloading Awesomium 1.7.2 for Linux 64-bit!
This build does not yet contain .NET/Mono bindings and only supports offscreen
views at this time.

To install this library and compile the Hello World sample, just run:
	sudo make all

You should then be able to change directories to the ./bin directory and run
the following samples (you may need to install SDL for the WebFlow sample):
	./awesomium_sample_hello
	./awesomium_sample_webflow

To use most of the Awesomium API in your C++ code, just include the following:
	#include <Awesomium/WebCore.h>

To link against Awesomium 1.7.2 in your applications, just add "-lawesomium-1-7":
	g++ main.cpp -lawesomium-1-7

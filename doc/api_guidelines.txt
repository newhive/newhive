API routes are in form of

/api/COLLECTION/NAME[/ARGUMENT][/ARGUMENT][...]

COLLECTION is the name of the most relevant DB collection

NAME is to distinguish between different queries and joins of the same COLLECTION

ARGUMENTs are variables of the query that are guranteed to be a valid URL path,
e.g. username, expr path, or an enumeration.

It is especially important that ARGUMENTS are not mistakenly placed in the NAME
position, because this creates ambiguous URLs.

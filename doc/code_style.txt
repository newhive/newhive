Naming conventions of variables and constant values
    all words separated by underscores
    Constructors are capitalized

    Language style, wording:
        Avoid excessively long and short names. One or two words is ideal, 3 is definitely necessary, if you find yourself putting four words in a name, please reconsider

        Certain abreviations are encouraged, when the meaning is obvious, ex: expr instead of expression.

        If word order is not obvious, pick the one that sounds intuitively
        correct, ex: view_expr instead of expr_view

JavaScript
    In constructors use an empty object called 'o' to serve as this. Avoid use
    of this, new, and prototype keywords unless absolutely required for
    compatibility with library code

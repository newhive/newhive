{% call p(class=p_outside_box) %}
We're excited to announce some new features, fixes and a bunch of new
newhives (thanks to everyone in the NewHive community)!
{% endcall %}

{% call p(class=p_outside_box) %}
Things are changing fast around here.  We haven't "launched" publicly, but the
time has come to open up our little community to the rest of the net.
{% endcall %}

<table style="margin: 0 0 43px 0;">

{% call h2() %}
Check out the new features we're rolling out this week:
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Invite Your Friends") %}
If you dig NewHive, pass it on! The next time you log
in you'll see a pink box in the upper left hand corner.  Click it and you can
send NewHive invites to your friends.
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Star") %}
See a cool newhive or collection that you want to keep track of?  Click the
"star" icon in the upper right corner.  "Starring" means you'll be notified of
updates and comments on those newhives you really dig, and can find them
later by clicking the star tab on your profile.
{% endcall %}

{% call p('"Listen to"') %}
Would you like to follow someone's activity on the site?  On every users
profile there's now an icon of a person with a "+" (get to their profile by
clicking the name in the upper right corner of any newhive).  Clicking this
means you're adding them to the network of people you're listening to.  You'll
be notified of their new newhives, comments, and starring.
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Discussions" ) %}
Ever wished you could leave comments on newhives? Now you can!  Just click
the "speech bubble"  in the upper-right corner to join the discussion.
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Shapes") %}
You can now add simple shapes to your newhives!   On the top of the screen
there's an icon with some geometry.  Click it and you'll know what to do :)
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Background Images") %}
Click "Background" under the image drop down to customize
your newhives with full screen background images and colors.
{% endcall %}

{% call p("Share") %}
And remember that if you ever want to share a newhive with your friends via
email, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or Google+ just use the little paper airplane
in the upper right hand corner.  You can also check out the number of views
your newhive has or embed your newhives using this nifty tool.
{% endcall %}

{% call p() %}
Want a feature? Email info@newhive.com or click the "feedback" button in
the lower right hand corner.
{% endcall %}

{% call p() %}
You make us a community, thank you!
{% endcall %}

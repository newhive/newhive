The Fontspring License Agreement
Version 1.1 - February 9, 2010

By downloading and/or installing font software from Fontspring, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement, in conjunction with the receipt that accompanies each purchase from Fontspring or its distributors, constitutes the complete Agreement between you and Fontspring.

1. Allowed Uses

You may use the licensed fonts to create graphics for display on any surface including computer screens, television screens, paper, t-shirts and any other surface where the image will be a fixed size.

You may also embed or link the licensed fonts in accordance with the rules described in Section Four of this license.

You may not create alphabet or letterform products for resale where the product consists of individual letterforms, including rubber stamps, die-cut products, stencil products, or adhesive sticker alphabet products where the likeness of the licensed fonts can be reproduced and the end-user of said products can create their own typesetting. 

You may create typographic products using the licensed fonts if the product consists of commonly recognized words or phrases. For example: a rubber stamp that has the words "Thank You" or a sticker that says "Great!"

If there are illustrations or images in the licensed fonts OTHER THAN letterforms, numbers, punctuation marks, diacritics, etc, you may NOT use the licensed fonts in a manner where the illustration or image becomes the primary aspect of a product for resale. For example, if an image was used on a coffee cup, to sell the coffee cup, or on a t-shirt to sell the t-shirt or on a greeting card to sell the greeting card, etc.

2. Number of Users

The licensed font may be simultaneously used by no more than the number of users specified in the receipt you received for the licensed font. All users must be located in the same geographic location. See Section Four for exceptions for embedding and linking.

3. Third parties and Transferability 

You may provide the font to a graphic designer, printer or other outputting service that is working on your behalf only if they agree to use the font exclusively for your work, agree to the terms of this license, and retain no copies of the font on completion of the work.

You may not distribute the font to third parties or make the font publicly accessible except by embedding or linking in accordance with the rules described in Section Four.

4. Embedding and Linking

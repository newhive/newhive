<p class="p1">THE NEW HIVE</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Date of last revision: August 26th, 2010. The New Hive is different from companies that derive profit from data mining and advertisement. We don't play that game. We do have Terms of Service to protect Ourselves (and You). Here are the basics: You own Your information. You agree that all information/data/pictures you post are your own creation or you are allowed to use them. You refrain from using the site in any way that could be interpreted as hateful/derogatory. Most of all, We want You to have fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Here's the small print: These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the relationship between You ("You") and AReflectionOf, LLC, doing business as "The New Hive", ("The New Hive", "We", or "Us") or "thenewhive.com" which includes all pages associated with that primary hypertext transfer protocol address ("Site" or "The New Hive"). These Terms shall be construed as a contract between You and AReflectionOf, LLC (d/b/a "The New Hive"). BY ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THENEWHIVE, YOU AGREE TO EACH OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THENEWHIVE:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">1. Privacy. Your privacy is very important to Us. You own everything You add to or create within TheNewHive (collectively "Data"). Our default sharing setting is full privacy, except your public profile, homepage and your public posts, and We will not collect any information about You or Your online habits (except in an anonymous, analytically fashion), unless You specifically change Your privacy settings. If You choose to create public posts, You will be sharing Your Data under the Creative Commons Attribution license. The Creative Commons copyright licenses allow certain uses by others without compensation depending on the particular license You choose. Also, if You choose to make public posts, We may use Your Data to enhance Your experience on The New Hive and to collect Data for informational and analytical purposes. Regarding any Data of Yours covered by intellectual property rights, You grant us a non-exclusive, fully paid up and royalty free, transferable, and international license to use the Data. That license ends when You remove the Data from Your account or You close Your account; however, if You have shared content with others, their license continues as it was when You shared the Data. Any Data You delete from Your account may remain on servers or otherwise in memory for a reasonable time until it is deleted from Our servers, and any Data licensed to others will remain on their account until they delete that Data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
